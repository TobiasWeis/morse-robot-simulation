# morse-robot-simulation
This repo contains a MORSE robot simulation project.

To run it with morse:

    morse import my_first_sim
    morse run my_first_sim

To connect with my client and visualize the sensor readings (slow b/c matplotlib):

    ./my_first_sim/scripts/my_first_sim_client.py

I adapted it to feature a laserscanner as well as client-code to read and visualize measurements:

In the current state of the code, I included my own 3d-car-model,
as well as visualization scripts on the client-side to visualize live and integrated laser-data,
the camera image, as well as the odometry of the robot.
